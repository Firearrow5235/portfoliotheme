  <h3>My Self</h3>
  <p>Hello folks! My name is Gavyn. I live in Bakersfield, Vermont. I am a mostly self-taught developer with years of development experience. I started learning to code with Codecademy in January of 2013. Since then I've filled my days with hundreds of books, articles, video's, and projects. Today I still strive to be the best developer I can be and I continue to learn new things every day.</p>
